This role demands strong software engineering fundamentals, and a good understanding of networking including capabilities like L2, L3, and fundamentals of commercial switching HW.Your role will not be limited to a single aspect of EOS at Arista, but cover all aspects of EOS.


Responsibilities:


Write functional specifications and design specifications for features related to forwarding traffic on the internet and cloud data centers.
Implement solutions to small-sized problems in our EOS software, using the C, C++, and python programming languages.
Write test plan specifications for small-sized features in EOS, and implement automated test programs to execute the cases described in the test plan.
Debug problems found by our automated test programs and fix the problems.
Work on a team implementing, testing, and debugging solutions to larger routing protocol problems.
Work with the System Test Engineers to analyze problems found in their tests and provide fixes for those problems.
Review and contribute to the specifications and implementations written by other team members.
Help to create a schedule for the implementation and debugging tasks, update that schedule weekly, and report it to the project lead

Qualifications

BS Computer Science/Electrical Engineering/Computer Engineering + 2 years experience, or MS Computer Science/Electrical Engineering/Computer Engineering, or equivalent work experience
Knowledge of C, C++, and/or python
Knowledge of UNIX or Linux
Understanding of networking including at least one of the following areas is desirable:
IP routing protocols, such as RIP, OSPF, BGP, IS-IS, or PIM
Layer 2 features such as 802.1d bridging, the 802.1d Spanning Tree Protocol, the 802.1ax Link Aggregation Control Protocol, the 802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol, or RFC 1812 IP routing.
Ability to utilize, test, and debug packet forwarding engine and a hardware component’s vendor provided software libraries in your solutions.
Infrastructure functions related to distributed systems such as messaging, signalling, databases, and command line interface techniques.
Hands on experience in the design and development of ethernet bridging or routing related software or distributed systems software is desirable.
Applied understanding of software engineering principles
Strong problem solving and software troubleshooting skills.
Ability to design a solution to a small-sized problem, and implement that solution without outside help.Able to work on a small team solving a medium-sized problem with limited oversight.
